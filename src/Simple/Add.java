		Qualities of a Good Algorithm
		Input and output should be defined precisely.
		Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
		Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
		An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, 
		the algorithm should be written in such a way that 
		it can be used in different programming languages.
